In this activity, a java script code was created to add functionality to a password generation application.
The passwords generated by the application resulted in a random group of characters, based on user input regarding password criteria (upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters). 
The password lenght was determined by the user based on a set parameter (password must be between 8 and 128 characters).
